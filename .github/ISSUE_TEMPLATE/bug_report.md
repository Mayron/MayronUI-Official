### Instructions
1. Make sure you have updated each MUI addon to version 6.3.8 or higher before continuing.
    - use `/mui version` to find your version numbers.
2. Use the report feature:
    - If you see a Lua error popup, press the "Report MayronUI Bug" button and follow the instructions.
    - If you want to report a bug and there is no Lua error, use the `/mui report` in-game slash command and following the instructions.

Once you have generated a report, **replace all of these instructions** with your bug report and then submit it.
